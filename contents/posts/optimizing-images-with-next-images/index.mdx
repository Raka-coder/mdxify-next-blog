# Optimizing Images in Next.js 13+ with next/image and App Router

Next.js provides a powerful Image component through the `next/image` module, which offers automatic image optimization. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use this component effectively in a Next.js project using the App Router.

## Why Use next/image?

The `next/image` component offers several benefits:

1. Automatic image optimization
2. Responsive images
3. Lazy loading

## Basic Usage

Let's start with a basic example of how to use the Image component:

<FileName name="app/page.tsx" />

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <Image
        src="/example.jpg"
        alt="An example image"
        width={500}
        height={300}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

In this example, we're importing the Image component from next/image and using it to display an image located in the public directory.

## Key Props

The Image component accepts several props:

- `src`: The source URL of the image.
- `alt`: The alternative text for the image.
- `width`: The width of the image in pixels.
- `height`: The height of the image in pixels.
- `sizes`: An array of media queries and their corresponding image sizes.
- `priority`: A boolean value indicating whether the image should be prioritized.
- `placeholder`: The placeholder to display while the image is loading.
- `blurDataURL`: The base64-encoded data URL of the placeholder image.

## Responsive Images

To make images responsive, you can use the `sizes` prop to specify media queries and their corresponding image sizes. For example:

<FileName name="app/page.tsx" />
```tsx import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <Image
        src="/example.jpg"
        alt="An example image"
        width={500}
        height={300}
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw"
      />
    </main>
  )
}
```

In this example, the image will be displayed at 50% of the viewport width when the viewport width is less than 600px.

## Lazy Loading

By default, images are not lazy loaded. To enable lazy loading, set the `loading` prop to `"lazy"`:

<FileName name="app/page.tsx" />
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'
export default function Home() {
  
  return (
    
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
      <Image
        src="/example.jpg"
        alt="An example image"
        width={500}
        height={300}
        loading="lazy"
      />
    </main>
  )
}
```
In this example, the image will be loaded only when it's in the viewport.

## Conclusion

The `next/image` component is a powerful tool for optimizing images in Next.js 13+. By using the Image component effectively, you can improve the performance and user experience of your Next.js app.
